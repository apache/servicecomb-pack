## Features
* High availability. The coordinator is stateless and thus can have multiple instances.
* High reliability. All transaction events are stored in database permanently.
* High performance. Transaction events are reported to coordinator via gRPC and transaction payloads are serialized/deserialized by Kyro.
* Low invasion. All you need to do is add 2-3 annotations and the corresponding compensate methods.
* Easy to deploy. All components can boot via docker.
* Support both forward(retry) and backward(compensate) recovery.
* Easy to extend other coordination protocol which is based on the Pack, now we have Saga and TCC support out of box.

## Architecture
ServiceComb Pack is composed of  **alpha** and **omega**.
* The alpha plays as the coordinator. It is responsible for the management of transactions.
* The omega plays as an agent inside the micro-service. It intercepts incoming/outgoing requests and reports transaction events to alpha.


The following diagram shows the relationships among alpha, omega and services.
![Pack Architecture](docs/static_files/pack.png)

In this way, we can implement different coordination protocols, such as saga and TCC. See [ServiceComb Pack Design](docs/design.md) for details.

Now we have different lanaguage implementation of Omega
* Go lang version of Omega here https://github.com/jeremyxu2010/matrix-saga-go
* C# version of Omega here https://github.com/OpenSagas-csharp/servicecomb-saga-csharp

## Get Started
* For ServiceComb Java Chassis application, please see [Booking Demo](demo/saga-servicecomb-demo/README.md) for details.
* For Spring applications, please see [Booking Demo](demo/saga-spring-demo/README.md) for details.
* For Dubbo applications, please see [Dubbo Demo](demo/saga-dubbo-demo/README.md) for details.
* For TCC with Spring application, please see [Tcc Demo](demo/tcc-spring-demo/README.md) for details.
* To debug the applications, please see [Spring Demo Debugging](demo/saga-spring-demo#debugging) for details.

## Build and Run the tests from source

* Build the source code and run the tests
   ```bash
      $ mvn clean install
   ```
* Build the source demo docker images and run the accept tests
   ```bash
      $ mvn clean install -Pdemo
   ```
* Build the source code and docker images without running tests, the docker profile will be activated if the maven detects the docker installation.
   ```bash
      $ mvn clean install -DskipTests=true -Pdemo
   ```
* Build the release kit for distribution without running the tests, then you can find the release kits in the distribution/target directory.
  ```bash
     $ mvn clean install -DskipTests=true -Prelease
  ```
